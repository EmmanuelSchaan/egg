The process is based exclusively on empirical relations carefully calibrated on state-of-art observations from the deep CANDELS fields, in particular using data from the Hubble-WFC3 camera and Herschel-PACS and SPIRE. The \"root\" element of the simulation process is the stellar mass of each galaxy, which is used to derive statistically the dust content, star formation rate, optical colors and morphology. The full panchromatic spectrum of the galaxy is generated from this set of parameters, and by construction the resulting flux distributions reproduce accurately the observed ones.\r\n\r\nThe generated catalogs can be used to produce realistic maps and mock observations to test source extraction codes, or to evaluate the reliability of any map-based science (stacking, dropout identification, ...).\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n\r\nBelow is a comparison between real observations from the GOODS-South field (left) and a similar region of the sky simulated with Ifni (right).\r\n\r\n![](simu_example.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Reference\r\n\r\nC.
