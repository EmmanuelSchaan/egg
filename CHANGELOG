v1.0.5
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed redshift bins getting too large when zmin is itself relatively large.
 - Stellar SEDs are no longer attributed to galaxies when the 'no_stellar' option is set.
 - Fixed columns being empty in the output FITS catalog, as some languages/libraries do not
   like this.


v1.0.4
======

New/updated features:
 - Added the rest-frame filters U, B and V (useful to compute UVJ colors).
 - 'egg-getsed' can now produce the full (disk+bulge) SED of a galaxy rather than only producing
   either the disk or the bulge SED. Simply omit the 'component' option to do that.
 - Changed the algorithm to determine the lowest mass generated as a function of redshift when the
   'maglim' option is used. This new algorithm takes into account the typical colors (and M/L) of
   galaxies as a function of mass and redshift, so that 'egg-gencat' generates fewer galaxies below
   the requested magnitude limit, while remaining complete above that limit.

Changes in EGG recipes:
 - The z=4 stellar mass function is now given a shallower faint end slope, and this slope is made
   also shallower at higher redshifts, with a cap at -2.1 to prevent exploding the counts.
 - The mass-to-light ratio of z>6 galaxies is adjusted to match the observations of Song+16.
 - Bluer templates are added to the stellar library to cover a wider region of the UVJ plane.
   This region is populated at high redshift and low masses.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed linking error with libdwarf and libelf.
 - Fixed typo in libelf CMake script.
 - Fixed phy++ CMake script to account for new header structure.
 - Fixed typo in documentation.


v1.0.3
======

Changes in EGG recipes:
 - Tweaked the stellar mass functions at z>4 to match the observations of Grazian+14.
   This involves having a steeper low mass slope, and a re-calibrated evolution of the
   total stellar mass density at z>6.
 - Stopped the evolution of the UVJ colors beyond z=3.3 to prevent galaxies from becoming
   too blue.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed crash when zmin is given a too high value.
 - Fixed errors when libunwind is not installed on the system.

Install script:
 - Fixed error in the the name of the EGG temporary source directory.
 - Removed usage of 'grep -Po' for MacOS compatibility. Using 'sed' instead.


v1.0.2
======

Changes in EGG recipes:
 - Added a manual correction to the mass-to-light ratios of z<1.3 galaxies.
   These galaxies are given a higher M/L to account for aging populations that is not accounted
   for by the UVJ colors alone.
 - Re-calibrated the half light radii of bulges to improve galaxies at z<0.5.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed crash when generating too narrow redshift slices.

Install script:
 - Now downloading and building all required dependencies (cfistio and wcslib).
 - The libraries downloaded by the script are no longer installed on the system, but instead
   are build and isolated in the temporary directory. Only EGG is installed.


v1.0.1
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed errors in the CMake scripts and removed dependencies on linfit and LAPACK.


v1.0.0
======

Initial release.
