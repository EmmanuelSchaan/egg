v1.4.0
======

New/updated feature:
 - Added a limited set of optical emission lines (Ly-alpha, [OII], [OIII], Balmer series, [NII]) and far-infrared emission lines ([CII]157, [NII]205, CI, CO ladder). The line fluxes are tied to  the generated SFR, metallicity (through the FMR), LIR, or Mgas (through Mdust), with recipes calibrated on various observations, and the usual random scatter. Optical lines will be attenuated using a different attenuation than the continuum. The lines can be disabled by setting the flag 'no_nebular'.


v1.3.1
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed position angle being limited to -45 to +45 degrees instead of -90 to +90 degrees.


v1.3.0
======

New/updated feature:
 - A new IGM absorption method is added, using the Inoue+14 prescription and allowing for scatter in the IGM absorption at a given redshift due to varying lines of sight through the IGM. For this occasion, the "naive_igm" option has been removed: instead the user can now choose which IGM recipe they want to use using the "igm=..." option. See help for more info. The new Inoue+14 IGM with scatter is now the default in EGG. Other methods ("constant", equivalent to the previous "naive_igm=1", and "madau95", equivalent to the previous "naive_igm=0") do not have scatter implemented.
 - It is now possible to generate galaxies without any IGM absorption using "igm=none".


v1.2.1
======

New/updated feature:
 - Updated to latest vif API, no consequence at all on the code and outputs.


v1.2.0
======

New/updated feature:
 - The library of stellar SEDs was updated. The new version has several interesting improvements. First, each SED in the library is now garanteed to have its UVJ colors matching its position on the UVJ grid. Second, the SEDs were produced by fitting observed galaxies with a broader range of star formation histories, so they should display more diversity. Third, these fits were done excluding the broadbands containing [OIII] and Hbeta, therefore the contamination from emission lines is mitigated (this should enable adding emission lines to the EGG SEDs without biases).
 - The recipes for assigning UVJ colors to bulges and disks were revised to improve agreement with observations. The scatter of blue colors along and across the UVJ sequence is increased, so blue components at a fixed mass have a larger variety of SEDs. Quiescent galaxies can no longer have blue colors for either their disks or bulges; this reproduces better the bimodality in the UVJ diagram.

Bug fixes:
 - The stellar mass function at 0<z<0.5 was incorrectly interpolated (z=0 and z>=0.5 were not affected).


v1.1.0
======

New/updated feature:
 - Improved the treatment of IGM absorption. Now the absorption is computed on a per-galaxy basis, based on the redshift. Before that, the IGM absorption was quite poorly implemented, as a single value of the absorption for the entire catalog with no redshift dependence. The old behavior of the code can be recovered by setting the "naive_igm" flag on the command line.


v1.0.9
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed output SEDs produced by egg-getsed containing duplicate values when the component='...' option was not used. This fix should also improve performances of egg-gencat.


v1.0.8
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed a compilation error with recent versions of CFITSIO (CURL dependency).


v1.0.7
======

New/updated features:
 - Added Av as an output of the simulation.

Bug fixes:
 - Added sanity checks for input filters.


v1.0.6
======

New/updated features:
 - Added JWST and ALMA filters.

Changes in EGG recipes:
 - The mass functions can now reach z=15, however this is a wild extrapolation!
 - The recipes for Tdust and IR8 have been updated to the relations published in Schreiber et al. (2018).

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed documentation for 'filter_db' parameter.
 - Fixed issues with WCSLib and distortion in FITS headers.


v1.0.5
======

New/updated features:
 - Added the 'max_dz' option (default is 0.5) to avoid generating too broad redshift slices.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed redshift bins getting too large when zmin is itself relatively large.
 - Fixed the 'min_dz' option doing nothing.
 - Stellar SEDs are no longer attributed to galaxies when the 'no_stellar' option is set.
 - Fixed columns being empty in the output FITS catalog, as some languages/libraries do not
   like this.


v1.0.4
======

New/updated features:
 - Added the rest-frame filters U, B and V (useful to compute UVJ colors).
 - 'egg-getsed' can now produce the full (disk+bulge) SED of a galaxy rather than only producing
   either the disk or the bulge SED. Simply omit the 'component' option to do that.
 - Changed the algorithm to determine the lowest mass generated as a function of redshift when the
   'maglim' option is used. This new algorithm takes into account the typical colors (and M/L) of
   galaxies as a function of mass and redshift, so that 'egg-gencat' generates fewer galaxies below
   the requested magnitude limit, while remaining complete above that limit.

Changes in EGG recipes:
 - The z=4 stellar mass function is now given a shallower faint end slope, and this slope is made
   also shallower at higher redshifts, with a cap at -2.1 to prevent exploding the counts.
 - The mass-to-light ratio of z>6 galaxies is adjusted to match the observations of Song+16.
 - Bluer templates are added to the stellar library to cover a wider region of the UVJ plane.
   This region is populated at high redshift and low masses.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed linking error with libdwarf and libelf.
 - Fixed typo in libelf CMake script.
 - Fixed phy++ CMake script to account for new header structure.
 - Fixed typo in documentation.


v1.0.3
======

Changes in EGG recipes:
 - Tweaked the stellar mass functions at z>4 to match the observations of Grazian+14.
   This involves having a steeper low mass slope, and a re-calibrated evolution of the
   total stellar mass density at z>6.
 - Stopped the evolution of the UVJ colors beyond z=3.3 to prevent galaxies from becoming
   too blue.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed crash when zmin is given a too high value.
 - Fixed errors when libunwind is not installed on the system.

Install script:
 - Fixed error in the the name of the EGG temporary source directory.
 - Removed usage of 'grep -Po' for MacOS compatibility. Using 'sed' instead.


v1.0.2
======

Changes in EGG recipes:
 - Added a manual correction to the mass-to-light ratios of z<1.3 galaxies.
   These galaxies are given a higher M/L to account for aging populations that is not accounted
   for by the UVJ colors alone.
 - Re-calibrated the half light radii of bulges to improve galaxies at z<0.5.

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed crash when generating too narrow redshift slices.

Install script:
 - Now downloading and building all required dependencies (cfistio and wcslib).
 - The libraries downloaded by the script are no longer installed on the system, but instead
   are build and isolated in the temporary directory. Only EGG is installed.


v1.0.1
======

Bug fixes:
 - Fixed errors in the CMake scripts and removed dependencies on linfit and LAPACK.


v1.0.0
======

Initial release.
